        <div> <strong><em><mark> CSS:-</mark></em></strong> Cascading style sheets. </div>
        <div> A language for describing the visual appearence of web pages, including properties such as 
            their layout , colors and fonts. 
        </div>

        <p> <strong> Using CSS </strong> you'll able to greatly improve the look your 
        <em> HTML </em> pages. </p>

        <hr>

        <h2><p><strong><mark><em> DSS Lesson(3) </em></mark></strong></p></h2>
        <p> When you load a web page, somehow the browser takes a piece of <mark> HTML </mark>
            text, and it creats the two dimensional image that appears in your browser window. </p>

            <div> <h3><mark><em><strong> Data structure:- </strong></em></mark></h3><br>
                It's a sort of organise map of what's going to end up on the page, it's also what developer tools
            let's us look at. </div>

            <div> When the browser read the <mark> HTML </mark> source it builds up
            a map in the computer's memory of what all the elements are that it will need to put on the screen.<br>
            This map shows which elements are nested inside which other elements, <em> doing this 
                step first 
            </em> makes a much more practical to log out the elements on the screen, it's kind of like 
         making an out line of the page, this kind of structure is called <mark> TREE STRUCTURE.
             <br>
         </mark>
         Because, each element can have branches coming out of it to other elements, for each element
         there will be branches going to the elements that are nested inside of it, like <em> (li) </em>
         or <strong> list items </strong> inside the <em> (ol) </em> or <strong> ordered lists. </strong></div>

         <div> The particular tree structure that the browser builds out of <mark> HTML </mark>
         is called the <mark> "DOM" </mark> or <strong> DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL </strong>. The <mark> DOM 
         </mark> has a tree structure for each <mark> HTML </mark> element.</div>

         <hr> 
         
         <h2> <p>  <strong> <mark><em> DSS Lesson(5) </em></mark></strong></p></h2>

         <p> Every element that appears on the page gets <strong>laid out</strong> into a box, <br>
         and these boxes land inside of other boxes. <em>And the layout of these boxes</em>, <br>
         it's controlled by the tree structure with a little help from the <mark> CSS.</mark>  </p>
         
         <hr>

         <h2><p><mark><strong><em> DSS Lesson (6) </em></strong></mark></p></h2>

         <div> If we wanna apply a style to <strong> every tag </strong> like 
         <ol> <li style="color:red"> (li) </li>
              <li style="color:green"> (ol) </li>
              <li style="color:blue"> (p) </li>
              <li style="color:yellow"> (ul) </li></ol>
         in the document instead of just one at a time, <br>
         <em> One way we can do that </em> is by putting a <mark> CSS 
         </mark> rule set into the document's head element by creating a special element
         called <strong> (style) </strong> </div>

         <div> The <em> (style) </em> information that we'll put it in the head will be
         applied throughout the document. </div>

         The <strong> selector </strong> is the part that says which <mark> HTML </mark>

         The <strong> Declaration block </strong> says how the rule will <em> modify </em> these elements. </p>

             If you wanna style something or part of something like <strong> (p) paragraphs </strong>
             you can use the <em>  class  </em> attribute. 
         </div>

         <div> <mark> Class :- </mark> A group of things with the same characteristics. (In general) </div>
         <div> <mark> Class :- </mark> It's just a special attribute that we can use it to tell the browser,
         <mark> for instanse </mark> some paragraphs need to have different style that other paragraphs. (In our lesson)</div>

         <p> Use a <strong> Class </strong> when there could be several elements that need the same style. <br>
         Use an <em> Id </em> when there's only one element to apply it to. </p>

            <p> Here are some important CSS terms that you've learned so far: <br>
            
            <ol><ul><li> <strong>DOM </strong>, or Document Object Model, is a tree structure with a node for each HTML element, piece of text, image, and any other object in the web page.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Selectors</strong> are one part of the CSS ruleset. They indicate which HTML element(s) the rule is for.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Declaration blocks</strong> are the other part of the CSS ruleset, they say how the rule will modify the elements indicated by selectors.</li>
                    <li> CSS <strong>rules</strong> are composed of a selector followed by a declaration block.</li>
                    <li> <strong>type</strong> is the simplest kind of selector. It indicates the name of one type of HTML element (such as em or li).</li>
                    <li> <strong>class</strong> in HTML is an attribute that groups elements together that you want to have the same style.</li>
                    <li> <strong> id </strong> is an attribute that must be unique to a single element, used to identify it.</li></ul></ol></p>

        <h3><p><strong><mark><em> CSS selectors </em></mark></strong></p></h3>

        <p> You've now learned about three kind of CSS selectors: <strong>type, class, and ID!</strong>
        
            <strong>Type</strong> selectors are used to apply a style to a particular type of HTML element, like h1 or body. <br> Type selectors are written using just the type name.
            <strong>Class</strong> selectors are used to set the style for multiple HTML elements that have a particular value for the class attribute.<br> You can name a class anything you want! Class selectors are written with a dot before the class: for elements such as (p class="blue"), <br> the class selector is .blue.\
            <strong>ID</strong> selectors are used when the style is being applied to one HTML element, which has to have an id attribute. <br> There can be only one element with a particular id on a page. You can also choose any name you want for an id, just like a class.<br>  ID selectors are written using a # sign: for an element such as (div id="sidebar"),<br> the id selector is #sidebar.</p>

            <p> <mark> <strong> What so cascading about cascading style sheets..?? </strong></mark> <br> 
            
            Well, cascading has to do with how each node in the <strong> DOM </strong> tree gets its 
            styles to find. <br> <em> Basically </em>, any style property to find on a node will apply as 
            a default to all that nodes <strong> descendants </strong>. </p>

            <p> <mark><strong><em> SO </em></strong></mark>, <br>
            
            That's what so cascading about cascading style sheets, each style property that's define <br> 
            on a node will cascade or spill down the tree to that node's children and descendants. </p>

            <p> If you wanna make the same style for your <strong> HTML </strong> that you have it,

            <b> To do this you'll put a special tag in the<strong> HTML </strong> head. </b>

            <div> The web isn't a box of crayons, you should be able to make any color that you want and indeed you 
                can. <br> You can make new colors by mixing the <strong> primary colors </strong> :- <ol><ul>
                    <li class="red;">red</li>
                    <li class="green;">green</li>
                    <li class="blue;">blue</li>
                </ul></ol>
                for instance, If we mix <em> 100 </em> percent red with <em> 50 </em> percent green, we'll 
                get this bright orange. 
            </div>

            <div> In web browsers, each primary color(red, green, blue) can have 256 possible values.<br>
            This is because each primary color is stored in a single <em> byte </em>, a space in memory 
            that can hold a number from <strong> 0 </strong> to <strong> 255.</strong> We can write 
            a <em> byte </em> value as a number from <strong> 0 </strong> to <strong> 255,</strong> <br>
            bute we can also write it as a number in <mark> hexadecimal </mark> or hex base 16.</div>

            <p> In <strong> Hex, </strong> each digit can go from <em> Zero </em> to <em> Nine </em>, and then 
            from <em> A </em> to <em> F </em>. <mark> Hex codes </mark> are definitely harder for most folks 
            <br> to figure out, but they're traditional on the web and web designers like to joke around about them.</p>

            <p> ****      If you ask for a <em> font-family </em> and the user's device doesn't have it, 
            <strong> CSS </strong> just won't do anything<br> ( <em> it will just leave the text and the default <strong> font-family </strong>
            which is usually something boring but <mark> inoffensive</mark> </em>). </p>

            In Google Docs, Bold and Italic and Underline are all just buttons right next to each other , But in <strong> CSS </strong> 
            these are all controlled by different properties.<br>

        <p> <h3> The Flexbox :- </h3> <br>
        It's a way to ask <strong> CSS </strong> to change the rules for how boxes are laid out onto the page
        in away<br> That's more <em> flexible </em> than the usual document-based approach.</p>

        <p> The property  <mark> "display: flex;" </mark> will make the boxes side by side, and If the browser window is resized
            ,<em> these elements resize to fit the screen </em>.<br>
            Flexboxes gets us something that floats don't -  <em> when you don't have enough room or space on the web

        do many things that will help you at all of your working :- <br>
        <ol> <li> You will use a container <b>(call it what you want)</b> and do many things to it,

        </li> 
        <li> Then you will use the main element or the main class to put the properties to it, for instance
         <ul>   <li> <em> Width </em></li> <li><em> height</em></li> <li><em> Float </em></li> <li><em> The font-family </em>for the font that you are using it</li>
            <li> <em> border </em> if you want</li>
            <li> <em> list-style </em> you can use it to delete the points that it's behind the words </li>
            <li> <em> background-color </em> you can use it if you wanna apply a color for the background</li>
            <li> <em> margin </em> to make spaces between the boxes </li>
